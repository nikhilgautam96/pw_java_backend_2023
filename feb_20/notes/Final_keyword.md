# Final Keyword :-

- In Java, the final keyword can be applied to { variables, methods, and classes }.
    
    1. `Variables` : When final is applied to a variable, its value cannot be changed 
                    once it has been initialized. This is often used to create constants in Java.

    2. `Methods` : When final is applied to a method, the method cannot be overridden by 
                a subclass. This is often used to prevent changes to the behavior of a method 
                in a class hierarchy.

    3. `Classes` : When final is applied to a class, the class cannot be subclassed. 
                This is often used to prevent changes to the behavior of a class or to 
                ensure that a class has a specific set of functionality that cannot be altered.
                
- The final keyword in Java is used to denote immutability or prevent modification to 
    variables, methods, or classes.

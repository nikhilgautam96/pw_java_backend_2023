Note :- 
    One principle of OOPS should not violate the rules of the other principle.

Polymorphism :-
    . If one thing exists in more than one form it is called polymorphism .
    . Greek word, "poly" = "many"  &  "morphism" = "structure of forms" .
    . Main purpose of using polymorphism is to reduce the number of lines of code .
    eg :-
        A person is student in school, son/daughter in front of parent, 
        brother/sister with siblings, grand-son/daughter infront of grandparents, etc.
    
    . Two types of polymorphism.
        1. Static polymorphism   or  compile time polymorphism
                eg :-  Overloading
        2. Dynamic polymorphism  or  run time polymorphism
                eg :-  Overriding

Method Overloading :-
    . The process of extending the existing method functionality with new functionality is called
      Method Overloading.
    . Different method signature must be provided to the methods.
    . we can implement overloading with or without inheritance.

Method Overriding :-
    . The process of replacing the existing method functionality with new functionality is
      called method overriding.
    . The same method prototype must be provided to the methods.
    . It only works with "Inheritance".
    . If we are able to create parent type reference for child type object, then we an say 
      we have achieved polymorphism.
